# Portfolio App

My portfolio app showcases placeholder projects and enables people to contact me.

## Technologies
It uses an HTML/CSS/JS frontend that asynchronously accesses data from a db.json file using json-server. 

## Description
It returns a collection of 5 objects that are projects in my portfolio. Each object has 4 attributes:

1. ID
2. Project image
3. Description
4. Industry
5. Likes

There are 4 unique event listeners that enable interactivity:

1. Click to hide & show About me
2. Filter projects
3. Submit Contact form
4. Liking projects

## Roadmap
- [ ] Refactor code.
- [ ] Add the why, audience, problem, solution, and impact to the placeholder projects from my work experience.
